# Customer and Product Segmentation & KPI Analysis Using SQL

## Business Problem

The business was unable to analyze customer behavior and product performance, leading to losses and inefficient targeting.

1) **Lack of Customer Insights**:
   - Unable to segment the age into specific age groups, making it difficult to tailor marketing strategies and target ads.
   - Unable to identify the VIPs, regular, and newbie customers.
   - Unable to calculate the lifespan (business relationship with the company) of the customer. 

2) **Product Performance**:
   - Unable to track sales trends over time.
   - Unable to segment products into high selling, low selling, etc.
   - Without recency and lack of product KPIs such as average order value, average monthly revenue, we cannot decide how the product is performing, which can lead to overstocking and understocking.

## Goal of the Project

To analyze customer behavior and product performance using SQL in order to segment customers, classify products, and generate key performance indicators (KPIs) that support data-driven decisions in marketing, sales, and inventory management.

## Project Overview

This is a SQL Data Analysis Project which analyzes customer and sales data over the years.

The steps included in this project were:

1) **Data Warehousing** → Organize, structure, and prepare the data.  
2) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** → Performing basic aggregations and writing basic queries.  
3) **Advanced Data Analytics** → Complex queries, window functions, deriving new dimensions through measures, and grouping the data accordingly to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
